# Force client-side SSL redirection.

# If a user types `example.com` in his browser, even if the server
# redirects him to the secure version of the site. That still leaves a
# window of opportunity (the initial HTTP connection) for an attacker
# to downgrade or redirect the request.

# The following header ensures that browser will ONLY connect to your
# server via HTTPS, regardless of what the users type in the address
# bar.

# (!) Remove the `includeSubDomains` optional directive if the site's
# subdomains are not using HTTPS.
